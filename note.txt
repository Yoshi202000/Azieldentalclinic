doctor account settings have error with pushing the services array that cannot remove all services from mongodb before updating the services

I have to create an admin, doctor, superadmin dashboard (done but need to fix the content)
super admin === no filter
admin clinic filter
doctor clinic filter or email filter
statistic(AdminFee/SuperAdminFee) need to filter by services from available clinic services

- superadmin dashboard

can view all the information from both clinic 

    - view profile
        - no need to have an services array so hidden
        - for the role, only the patient cannot see their role
